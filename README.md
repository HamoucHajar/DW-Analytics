# DW-Analytics

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Data Warehouse for agricultural data** using a **Star Schema**.  
It integrates **Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)** for ETL processes and **Power BI** for data visualization and analytics, enabling **data-driven decision-making in agriculture**.

## Technologies Used
- **Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)** – for extracting, transforming, and loading agricultural data  
- **Data Warehouse Star Schema** – fact and dimension tables for optimized querying  
- **Power BI** – for interactive dashboards and reporting  
- **Source Data** – agricultural datasets from CSV files or databases  

## Project Structure
- **PDI/** – transformations, and source files  
- **PowerBI/** – Power BI reports, dashboards, and exported visuals  
- **Docs/** – **PDI presentation** and **project guide**
  
## **PowerBI/**

## Key Features
- **Star Schema Design**: Optimized for querying agricultural metrics and dimensions  
- **ETL Workflow**: Automated extraction and transformation of agricultural data with PDI  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visual analysis with Power BI to support decision-making  
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Facilitates informed decisions in agricultural management

## How to Use
1. Open the **PDI files** in Pentaho to explore the ETL transformations of agricultural data.  
2. Load the transformed data into **Power BI** to visualize dashboards and reports.  
3. Check the **PDI presentation** and **project guide** in the `Docs/` folder.


## Objective
To provide a **structured, efficient, and visually engaging representation of agricultural data** that supports **data-driven decisions** in farming and agricultural management.
